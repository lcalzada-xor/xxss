# Roadmap

## v2.4.0 - Advanced Detection & Performance

- [ ] **WAF Bypass Module**: Automated WAF evasion techniques (encoding, obfuscation).
- [ ] **Improved Reporting**: HTML report generation with syntax highlighting and remediation advice.

## v3.0.0 - The "Smart" Release
- [ ] **Machine Learning Analysis**: Experimental ML model to classify potential vulnerabilities based on code patterns.
- [ ] **API Scanning**: Dedicated mode for scanning REST and GraphQL APIs.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow community-contributed detection modules (Lua or Go plugins).
